# Website Improvement: Full Basket System Integration

## Overview of the Improvement

As part of enhancing the interactivity and functionality of my Fennec FC website, I implemented a fully-featured, responsive basket system. This replaces what was previously a static merchandise section with a realistic, interactive shopping cart experience. The new system allows users to view, manage, and complete their shopping journey in a structured and user-friendly interface.

This improvement aligns with real-world front-end development practices and demonstrates the application of state management, DOM manipulation, styling consistency, and responsive design.

## Features Implemented

### Functional Features:
- **Add to Basket (from merchandise.html)**: When a user adds an item, it's saved to `localStorage` as a structured object.
- **Persistent Basket State**: Basket items are retained across page reloads and navigation using `localStorage`.
- **Dynamic Basket Page (`basket.html`)**:
  - Displays a live list of basket items pulled from local storage
  - Shows total cost in real-time
  - Allows item removal with animation feedback
  - Disables checkout when the basket is empty
- **Toast Notifications**:
  - Inform users when they attempt to checkout with an empty basket
  - Show confirmation after successful checkout
- **Checkout Logic**:
  - Empties the basket after confirming checkout
  - Displays a message and redirects users automatically

### Visual/UX Features:
- **Consistent Styling**: Styled to match the existing black and gold Fennec FC theme.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes, including mobile.
- **Animation Effects**:
  - Fade-out on item removal
  - Smooth transitions on overlay and text

## Why This Improvement Was Important

Before this update, the merchandise experience lacked a realistic user journey. Items could be “added” to a basket with no persistent state, no visibility, and no checkout path. This improvement brings the following advantages:

- Simulates real e-commerce logic
- Encourages users to engage with the merchandise page
- Demonstrates use of modern front-end technologies and concepts
- Adds tangible value to the site, moving it closer to a professional product

## Learning Outcomes Met

This improvement directly contributes to the learning outcomes of the module:

- **K1:** Used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a fully functional front-end system
- **K2:** Designed a reusable, real-world interface with effective user interaction
- **K3:** Demonstrated dynamic client-side scripting with stateful logic
- **K4:** Added to a responsive, accessible, and branded multi-page site

## Summary
This basket system is a complete enhancement that adds depth to the user experience, interactivity, and technical capability of the Fennec FC website. It shows the ability to build modular, realistic components that could scale into a production-grade project. It demonstrates not only technical skill but user-centered thinking — and ties together functionality, feedback, and frontend polish.
