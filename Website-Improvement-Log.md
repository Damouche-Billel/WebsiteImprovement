## Justification

These improvements were implemented to align the website with real-world front-end expectations for e-commerce functionality and user interaction. The enhancements reflect a deeper understanding of:

- DOM manipulation and event-driven design
- Persistent state management with localStorage
- User experience and responsive UI design
- Accessibility and usability standards
- Clean, modular code practices

## Notes

The improvements were developed locally and committed in one stage to GitHub. Therefore, the version control history does not show incremental progress. However, this document outlines all key changes made during development. See the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Damouche-Billel/WebsiteImprovement) for the updated codebase and final implementation.
